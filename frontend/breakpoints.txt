it appears that all mobile devices thinner than 415 pixels display the mobile bar.

devices wider than 415 pixels display the sidebar.


If you go to Twitter and log in, you'll notice there is a sidebar on the left and a sidebar on the right. 

Below 1280px, the left sidebar collapses. When you shrink the page down below 1000px, the right sidebar disappears. 

Finally below about 420px (in my dev tools anyway), the left sidebar disapperas to be replaced by a bar on the 
top and bottom of the screen providing similar functionality.
